# Vulnerable Driver Demonstration Project

This project demonstrates how to exploit a vulnerable driver to gain access to physical memory on a Windows system. The purpose of this project is purely educational, aiming to raise awareness about potential security risks and to highlight the importance of securing driver implementations.

## Introduction

This program is a demonstration of a Windows exploit that leverages a vulnerable driver to access and manipulate physical memory. It highlights the risks associated with poorly secured driver implementations and the need for robust security measures in software development.

## Usage

The main functionality is contained in `main.cpp`. Here are the key operations:

- Adjusting necessary privileges
- Opening the vulnerable driver
- Accessing and reading physical memory

## Explanation

This code in the `PhysicalMemory` namespace interacts with physical memory using a vulnerable driver:

- **openPhysicalMemory()**: Retrieves and maps physical memory ranges and stores them in `g_physicalMemoryRanges`.

- **closePhysicalMemory()**: Unmaps previously mapped physical memory ranges.

- **readPhysicalMemory(address, buffer, size)**: Reads from a specified physical memory address into a buffer, handling exceptions.

- **writePhysicalMemory(address, buffer, size)**: Writes to a specified physical memory address from a buffer, handling exceptions.

- **getPhysicalMemoryRange(address)**: Retrieves the physical memory range containing the specified address.
